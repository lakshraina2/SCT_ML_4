# Hand Gesture Recognition with PyTorch

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed as the **final task** for my **Machine Learning Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**. It implements a sophisticated deep learning solution for recognizing hand gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with PyTorch.

The system classifies different hand gestures including palm, fist, thumb, index finger, OK sign, and other common gestures using a custom CNN architecture with advanced training techniques including data augmentation, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.

## Dataset Structure

The project uses a labeled dataset of hand gesture images organized in the following structure:

```
leapGestRecog/
├── 00/
│   ├── 01_palm/         # Palm gesture images
│   ├── 02_l/            # L gesture images
│   ├── 03_fist/         # Fist gesture images
│   ├── 04_fist_moved/   # Moved fist gesture images
│   ├── 05_thumb/        # Thumb gesture images
│   ├── 06_index/        # Index finger gesture images
│   ├── 07_ok/           # OK sign gesture images
│   ├── 08_palm_moved/   # Moved palm gesture images
│   ├── 09_c/            # C gesture images
│   └── 10_down/         # Down gesture images
├── 01/
│   └── [similar structure with different subject]
└── ...
```

Each gesture category contains approximately 200 sequential frame images (e.g., `frame_00_01_0001.png` to `frame_00_01_0200.png`).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA out of memory**: Reduce batch size in `train.py`
2. **Dataset not found**: Check the `data_path` variable points to correct location
3. **Dependencies issues**: Ensure all packages are installed with correct versions

### Performance Tips

- Use GPU acceleration if available (CUDA)
- Adjust batch size based on available memory
- Consider data augmentation for better generalization
- Monitor training/validation loss to avoid overfitting
